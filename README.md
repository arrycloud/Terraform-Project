Architecture Explanation:
1.	VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
o	Created with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
o	Acts as the network container for all other resources
2.	Internet Gateway
o	Attached to the VPC
o	Enables communication between instances in the VPC and the internet
3.	Custom Route Table
o	Associated with the VPC
o	Contains a default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Internet Gateway
o	Controls traffic routing within the VPC
4.	Subnet
o	Created within the VPC (10.0.1.0/24)
o	Spans one availability zone
o	Where the EC2 instance will be launched
5.	Route Table Association
o	The subnet is explicitly associated with the custom route table
o	This overrides the main route table association
6.	Security Group
o	Acts as a virtual firewall for the EC2 instance
o	Rules allow:
	SSH (port 22) for instance management
	HTTP (port 80) for web traffic
	HTTPS (port 443) for secure web traffic
7.	Network Interface (ENI)
o	Created in the subnet with a specific private IP (10.0.1.5)
o	Provides networking capability to the EC2 instance
8.	Elastic IP
o	Associated with the network interface
o	Provides a static public IP address that persists after instance stops/starts
9.	Ubuntu EC2 Instance
o	Launched in the subnet
o	Has the network interface attached
o	Apache2 web server installed and enabled
o	Accessible via SSH (port 22) and web (ports 80/443)
Traffic Flow:
1.	Internet traffic reaches the instance via the Elastic IP
2.	The Internet Gateway routes traffic to the instance
3.	The Security Group filters allowed traffic
4.	The instance processes requests and serves web content via Apache2
This architecture provides a secure, publicly accessible web server with proper network isolation through the VPC and controlled access via the security group.



Professional Elements Included:
1.	Clear Hierarchy and Flow
o	Left-to-right data flow following AWS best practices
o	Proper spacing and alignment
2.	Component Details
o	Each AWS resource includes its identifier type (igw-, rtb-, sg-, etc.)
o	Security group rules explicitly listed
o	CIDR ranges clearly indicated
3.	Connection Paths
o	Arrows showing traffic flow (Internet → IGW → Route Table → Instance)
o	Elastic IP association shown
4.	External Interactions
o	Separate section for user access patterns
o	AWS management plane shown
5.	Consistent Styling
o	Uniform box shapes and borders
o	Proper spacing between components
o	Clean lines and connectors
6.	Technical Accuracy
o	Correct resource relationships (subnet→route table→IGW)
o	Proper ENI placement and IP assignment
o	Security group attached at instance level
7.	Multi-Layer View
o	Shows both infrastructure (VPC, subnet) and services (EC2)
o	Includes management plane interaction
8.	Annotations
o	Implicit labeling of the subnet as "Public" (since it routes to IGW)
o	Service configurations noted (Ubuntu, Apache2)
This diagram follows AWS Well-Architected Framework visualization standards and would be appropriate for professional architecture documentation, client presentations, or internal knowledge sharing. The layout emphasizes the public-facing nature of the web server while maintaining clear security boundaries.



Deployment Instructions:
1.	Prerequisites:
o	AWS CLI configured with credentials
o	Terraform installed
o	Existing SSH key pair in AWS (or modify the script to create one)
2.	Initialize & Deploy:
bash
Copy
Download
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
3.	Access Resources:
o	SSH: ssh -i your-key.pem ubuntu@$(terraform output -raw public_ip)
o	Website: Open URL from terraform output website_url
4.	Destroy Resources:
bash
Copy
Download
terraform destroy
Key Features of This Script:
1.	Exact Match to Architecture:
o	Implements all 9 components from the diagram
o	Maintains the same IP addressing scheme (10.0.1.5)
2.	Production-Ready Elements:
o	Explicit dependencies between resources
o	Proper tagging for all resources
o	Restricted security group (modify CIDR blocks for production)
3.	Automated Provisioning:
o	User-data script automatically installs/configures Apache
o	Elastic IP automatically associated with the ENI
4.	Outputs:
o	Displays the public IP and website URL after deployment
5.	Best Practices:
o	Clean resource separation
o	Version pinning for providers
o	Descriptive resource names
Note: For production use, consider adding:
•	CloudWatch monitoring
•	IAM instance profile
•	Backup configuration
•	Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
